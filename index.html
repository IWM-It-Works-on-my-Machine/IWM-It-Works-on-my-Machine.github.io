   <h3>Research</h3>
       <div class="textbox1">
      <p>Modern technologies and research are increasingly dependent on space-based technologies.
        While the space environment proves advantageous for numerous reasons ranging from lack of atmospheric interference to clearer observations, a major drawback is the
        limitation of the dimensions of the satellite. The increasing complexity of recent space missions often results in the requirement of larger equipment size.
        This poses transportation challenges to move infrastructure in space via single rocket launches.


        <br>
        <br>Placing larger satellites such as the James Webb Space Telescope amongst others has the added risk of overshooting launch vehicles’ capabilities and
        increases the risk of damage. Current assembly techniques involve highly complex robotic arms. However, although robotics and in-person assembly may
        achieve the accuracy needed, they significantly increase costs and result in higher risk factors. The future leans on in-space assembly techniques
        and transportation of parts with multiple launches to minimize risk and resources. The detailed overview is explained under the Research section.

       <p> <b>Guest Module </b>
       <br>
            A tentative positioning and rotational alignment is obtained via RF beacons. For increased precision and final positioning,
            a method similar to the one used in the ISS (host) sensors can be implemented. Four monopropellant thrusters with a compound
            such as hydrazine are used to obtain this alignment.
       <br>
       <br>
         <b> Host Module  </b>
         <br>
             The clamps retract to allow the guest module to slide in. After the widest cross-section has passed, the clamps
             return to their original position to lock in place. The clamps are coated with vulcanized rubber to enhance
             sealing for pressurization.
         <br>
         <br>
         <b> Pressure Systems (for manned and material transport missions) </b>
         <br>
            This is activated post-clamping. Nitrogen gas is inserted to verify the absence of gaps which cause leaks between guest and host.
            A nitrogen removal valve can be incorporated here to prevent insertion of excess nitrogen as this may compromise
            stress-related structural integrity. The nitrogen can then be flushed and replaced with oxygen to create habitable conditions
            in the host chamber.

         <br>
         <br>
            This is particularly useful for manned missions to prevent accidents due to depressurisation in case of motion
            between the modules.

         <br>
         <br>
         <b> Release Mechanism </b>
         <br>
          To release the guest module, the host chamber is depressurised and the clamps may be retracted using a simple hydraulic
          system. Thrusters can then be activated to propel the guest away from the host module.
